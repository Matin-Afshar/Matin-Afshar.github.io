  Welcome to my personal corner of the web, where I share insights about my research and interests in orthopedic biomechanics and computational biomechanics.
</p>

<p>
  My name is Mohammadjavad (Matin) Einafshar, and I am passionate about advancing the understanding of biomechanics through cutting-edge computational and experimental methods. Currently, I am a senior postdoctoral researcher in Orthopedic Biomechanics at Aalborg University, Denmark, working on projects like SPARK (focused on active knee prosthesis) and MathKOA (computer-driven, patient-specific knee osteoarthritis treatment) developing innovative patient-specific implants.

<p>
  My academic journey began with a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran, where I specialized in bone-implant interface mechanics and finite element modeling. During my doctoral studies, I was a visiting researcher at KU Leuven, Belgium, furthering my expertise in computational biomechanics. Over the years, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to collaborate with esteemed institutions such as Harvard Medical School, Radboud University, and KU Leuven.
