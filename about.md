title: About Me
---

Greetings! I am Mojtaba Barzegari, a passionate PostDoc researcher in computational engineering. Whether it's scientific computing, high-performance computing, or computational chemical/biomedical engineering, I'm all about using computers to solve real-world problems. I thrive on multi-disciplinary projects, relishing challenges in mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, medical and biological sciences, and materials science.

Currently, I work with the Electrochemical Materials and Processes group at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), where I model electrochemical processes of energy storage systems. But before that, I was a PhD researcher at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I worked on high-performance computational modeling of tissue engineering processes. I earned my BSc and MSc in materials science and biomedical engineering, respectively, both of which centered around the combination of numerical analysis and computational intelligence. And if that's not enough, I've also worked on Machine Learning and data analysis projects in the fields of medicine, biology, industrial automation, and IoT. For a comprehensive overview of my research experiences,  please refer to my [Research Portfolio](/research).

But wait, there's more! I've been building software for over 21 years (since 2003), tackling projects from IoT to large-scale enterprise applications. I am a big fan of the open-source software development model, and especially in the field of scientific computing, I stand firm as an open-source and open-science advocate. Take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://tuxriders.com/">TuxRiders</a> project for a prime example.

To gain further insight into my background, feel free to peruse my [CV](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mbarzegary/MyCV-shortened/blob/main/main.pdf). The source code of my CV is available on [this repository](https://github.com/mbarzegary/MyCV-shortened), granting you the chance to create your own if you like its format. (An outdated less-compact version is available [here](https://github.com/mbarzegary/MyCV).)

When I'm not doing science, I like to channel my inner rockstar by playing on bass and electric guitar, hoping to make a sound that's somewhat pleasing to the ear. I'm also an avid chess player, but don't let that fool you - I've been known to lose easily to a computer. And let's not forget my love for chatting with people - whether it's discussing the mysteries of the universe or debating the best pizza toppings, I'm happy to hear people's thoughts (even if I secretly think pineapple belongs on pizza).
