title: About Me
---

Hi there! I am Mohammadjavad (Matin) Einafshar, a passionate senior postdoctoral researcher specializing in orthopedic biomechanics and computational engineering. From finite element modeling to the design of patient-specific implants, I thrive on applying advanced computational and experimental methods to solve real-world medical and engineering challenges. I’m particularly drawn to interdisciplinary projects at the intersection of biomechanics, material science, and computational modeling.

Currently, I work as a senior postdoc at Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark, contributing to projects like SPARK, which focuses on developing active knee prostheses, and innovative strategies for stiffness mapping of brain tissues using elastography. My academic journey includes a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran, where I investigated bone-implant mechanics through experimental, computational, and in-vivo studies. I also had the privilege of conducting part of my doctoral research at KU Leuven, Belgium, honing my expertise in computational biomechanics and tissue engineering.

Over the years, I have collaborated with leading institutions like Harvard Medical School, KU Leuven, and Radboud University. My research spans areas such as bone-implant interaction, orthopedic implant design, musculoskeletal modeling, and machine learning applications in biomechanics. For a detailed overview of my research experiences and contributions, feel free to explore my Research Portfolio.

Beyond science, I have a strong interest in fostering innovation and sharing knowledge. I’m always keen to discuss topics ranging from biomechanics and computational modeling to cutting-edge technologies in medical engineering. Outside the lab, I enjoy engaging in creative pursuits and exploring the world of chess. Whether it’s delving into the mysteries of engineering or debating strategies for improving daily life, I’m always open to a good conversation.
